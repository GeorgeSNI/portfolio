                        <p>I love spending time with Una and Lucy. We enjoy getting out and about around Auckland and when we can further afield.</p>

                        <p>I often get out to the NZ sticks for some dirtbiking. I love the exhilaration and getting to see some of the beautiful contryside is a bonus.</p>
